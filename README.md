# Neural Machine Translation (NMT) Project

This project focuses on building a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system using a sequence-to-sequence model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The goal is to translate text from one language to another using deep learning techniques.

## Overview

The project utilizes the Keras library to implement a sequence-to-sequence model for Neural Machine Translation. The model is trained to learn the mapping between input sequences in one language and their corresponding translated sequences in another language.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. The project uses the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Keras
- Matplotlib

Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas keras matplotlib
```

Clone this Repo:

```bash
!git clone https://github.com/PraveenLiyanage/Neural-Machine-Translation-NMT.git
```
